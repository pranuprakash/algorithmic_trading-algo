# Project 2: Predicting Stock Returns using Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This project aims to predict stock price returns in financial markets by leveraging advanced machine learning models. It outlines the fundamental steps of data analysis, the implementation of machine learning models, and a detailed analysis of their performance and applicability.

## Required Packages
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas Datareader
- Scikit-Learn
- Warnings
- YFinance
- XGBoost
- Backtrader
- Quantstats
- Pyfolio
- JSON

## Required Datasets
- `tickers.nasd.csv`
- `tickers.nyse.csv`
- `tickers.csv`

## Project Description

### Model
The project employs XGBoost and Random Forest models, known for their robust performance in complex data environments such as financial markets.

### Model Training
The models are trained on 60% of the data samples and tested on the remaining 40%. Hyperparameters are fine-tuned to optimize performance, considering overfitting and generalization. True values are converted to binary to align with the evaluation metrics.

### Test Model Performance
The models are evaluated based on "Precision" and "Accuracy" metrics, with results indicating a slight surpassing of benchmark values. This section reports these findings, providing a basis for the models' effectiveness.

### Implement Trading Strategies
Two trading strategies are implemented using BackTrader based on the predictions from the best-performing models. Trading reports are generated as HTML files using PyFolio and Quantstats for the top-performing stocks, providing practical insights into the strategies' execution.

Certainly! Here's a concise version of the instructions to compile and execute the code:
